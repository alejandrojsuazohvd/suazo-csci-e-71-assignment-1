Hello class!

I've included the .idea directory to show that I setup Intellij. Normally I would create a git ignore for these files, but this assignment is an exception.

The project was completed in Intellij Ultimate 2020.2. See license photo below:

Here is Intellij Running on my machine:

The project was configured to have my name "Alejandro" as the command line argument. See the following photo for the run configuration:

The output is as follows

Note: Passing in no argument produces no "Hello" output.
